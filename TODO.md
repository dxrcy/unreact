# TODO

-   Client auto reconnect: try frequently, then after (10?) attempts, try less frequently
-   Add tests for each feature (compile check only?)

-   Don't copy public directory in dev ? Map route to workspace public folder

-   Merge `dev` and `watch` features ?
-   Re-add `watch_logs` config ?
